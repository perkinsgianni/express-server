Create a new server using the Express framework - Log all incoming requests with the morgan logging library - Serve the Top Spots project from the web server - Serve the Top Spots data from the web server - Update your Top Spots front end with your new back end.

You'll be using morgan to log each request to the console (on the server-side).

You will build a web server that will respond to requests for http://localhost:3000/ and return our application's resources.

The web server should also respond to GET requests at http://localhost:3000/data with all the data from data.json.
